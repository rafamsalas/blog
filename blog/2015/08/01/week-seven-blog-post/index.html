<div class="entry-content"><h1>YWebCA Week Seven</h1>

<h2>Class Update</h2>

<p> This was one of the more relaxed weeks so far. We&rsquo;ve gone through chapter 3 and reviewed it, as well as read the entire fourth chapter of the book. Kinda wondering where the physical copies of the books are though; we were told that we&rsquo;d have them about two weeks ago. Oh well, I&rsquo;ve done most of my reading on Google Drive, with my own notes and highlighting there. Anyways, I&rsquo;m ready for the chapter 4 worksheets and for knowing how to put all the pieces of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS together to make a good looking website. So far, I&rsquo;ve been able to keep up with everything and a little more. I&rsquo;ve also been really appreciative of MDN for all their help with CSS stuff. They&rsquo;ve been a real big help in terms of finding useful tips and tools for CSS elements. Chris Coyier&rsquo;s CSS Tricks are really helpful, since there are a lot of things that I&rsquo;ve tried to find explained very well by Chris Coyier. I really hope he&rsquo;ll be able to help us out for creating our sites, &lsquo;cause I know I will need a lot of help. So far, I&rsquo;ve really enjoyed working with CSS. I kinda favor CSS simply because it seems versatile and really open when it comes to designing a site&rsquo;s content.</p>

<p> I think out of all three languages (HTML, CSS, and JS), I have to say that I like CSS the most, with JavaScript as a close second simply because I&rsquo;m familiar to Java. HTML isn&rsquo;t my weak spot, per se, but I honestly prefer Markdown just because of its simplicity. I hope I&rsquo;ll later be able to figure out how to tie in Markdown so I&rsquo;ll save a lot of time rather than just building content with just HTML, since it&rsquo;s tedious at times. I don&rsquo;t mind HTML, I just think that if I need to create/structure a site&rsquo;s content real quick, I might as well just use Markdown.</p>

<h2>Moar Personal Stuffz</h2>

<p> I&rsquo;ve been pretty busy in terms of side projects. Recently, I&rsquo;ve been in some meetings for a student organization where we recently started a group project, called La Regeneracion, or Spanish for Regeneration. The point of the project is to have latin@ high school students conduct surveys with questions regarding issues in the latino community here in the Madison area, as well as issues latin@ students face. Later, the students, with the data they&rsquo;ve gathered through the survey, will be able to present their information through any medium; from art to theater to presentations to info-graphs, so on and so forth. Anyways, we&rsquo;ve been proactive in terms of working with high schools in Madison and the surrounding area to be part of the project. So far, we&rsquo;ve created an application for students to join the project, set up possible meeting dates with several schools and organized transportation for students to have meetings in Centro Hispano, a community building here in Madison. It&rsquo;s been a little tiring but I really think that in the end, it&rsquo;ll be worth it.</p>

<p> I&rsquo;ve also been busy with some applications for colleges and scholarships since I&rsquo;m at the verge of entering into my senior year. I&rsquo;m really looking forward to my last year of high school and my first year of college. I&rsquo;m really hoping to go to UW-Madison, for various reasons. The main reason, though, is that it&rsquo;s a school that has a lot of meaning to me. I&rsquo;ve been wanting to go to UW-Madison since the third grade, and it&rsquo;s only been upwards from there, in terms of wanting to go there. I&rsquo;ve been in several pre-college programs that were sponsored by UW-Madison, which were absolutely amazing. I&rsquo;ve been at several tours around campus, in which all of them have gotten me ecstatic to go here. I&rsquo;ve also made friends with UW students and staff, all of which were superb and really helpful. Lastly, I&rsquo;ve also made a promise with someone that I&rsquo;d go to UW-Madison with them, and I don&rsquo;t want to disappoint them. Still, I&rsquo;m a little unsure if I want to to Edgewood simply because of the agreement they have with my school.</p>

<p>  You see, my school basically will give students full tuition at Edgewood College <em>if</em> they are going into education and are willing to become teachers for my school district. They also have a strong emphasis for students of color <em>and</em> those who are interested into teaching technology. Honestly, when I learned about the opportunity, it seemed too good to be true. Sure enough, though it was true. I&rsquo;ve been thinking of going into Edgewood mostly because I&rsquo;d be able to have free tuition for something I actually would like to learn (though I&rsquo;m not so sure as to what to teach or major in) and to be able to teach, especially in the school district that I&rsquo;ve been in for the majority of my life. Thing is, I&rsquo;d need to be <strong>sure</strong> that I want to apply for Edgewood. In other words, no backing out; &ldquo;this is your final decision&rdquo; kinda shit. Luckly, I&rsquo;ll be able to have this opportunity as an alumni of my school, so I don&rsquo;t need to do this immediately after school.</p>

<p>   Yet, at the same time, I might want to take a break for a while off of school and just take get A+ and CISCO certified at Madison College, which means I&rsquo;d be certified to teach computer hardware and be certified by CISCO in networking. I don&rsquo;t really have any plans for going out of state or even out of Madison, but if I get accepted in a prestigious school, it&rsquo;d be hard for me to not accept it. I really wish this was easier. Now that I&rsquo;ve written a large wall of text, though, I seem to have come to a rather solid conclusion.</p>

<p>   So this is my plan for college:
   * Apply primarily for UW-Madison
   * Apply separately for Edgewood, without the tuition agreement
   * Apply for scholarships and hope I won&rsquo;t need student loans (Bernie for prez, pls)
   * Apply for Madison College</p>

<p>Seems like a <em>really</em> rough plan, but I think that with all the help I can get with friends, mentors, family, and teachers, as well as with the effort I put into this, I&rsquo;ll be able to go into my dream university and study somethi- shit, I don&rsquo;t even know what&rsquo;ll study for. <em>Fuck</em>, this is harder than I thought.</p>
