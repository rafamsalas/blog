## An Eventful Week
So this week was when we started doing some stuff with functions in Javascript. We have finally reviewed chapter 2 of the Eloquent Javascript book and the worksheet, and have now started with both chapter 3, which involves functions and we have also started to do some HTML and CSS through CodeSchool. So far, it seems that everyone is up to pace as to what we have been doing this week.

## Class Trip to Drifty's
On Friday, we took our first class trip to a local company here in Madison called Drifty, who is the company behind Ionic. Ionic is an SDK that is used to create native apps on both Android and iOS for websites and other stuff. We were able to get a nice tour of their office, which was pretty amazing. I really liked the ambiance and feel the place gave out. It was pretty chill and comforting, while still feeling productive. Anyways, we also had some Quizno's subs brought to us and ate while we watched two presentations, one from the CEO(!) of the company who gave us a good overview of Ionic, what it is, how to use it, and also did some live demonstrations on how it's so cool, and one from Firebase, a cloud service provider that does a lot of backend stuff, specifically on authenticating users through social media sites and accounts, such as Twitter and Facebook. The presenter also gave us a live coding example of how Firebase can be used in a chatroom setting by signing into Twitter. Overall, it was a great experience to have, as we all learned a lot about a usual tech company environment and workplace.

## Closure
Anyways, this was a great week for the class. I was also able to go out with friends this weekend to the capitol, both from the course and from my personal life. Overall, it was awesome.
