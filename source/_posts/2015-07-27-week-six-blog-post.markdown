## Class Stuff
This has been one of the more laid back weeks, but it feels a little more rushed. I guess that a lot of work piled up in one week makes it seem more stressful. Anyways, I've now finished chapter 3, with some help, and am being successful in CodeSchool. I've been messing around with some CSS stuff on my HTML skeleton and also been busy helping some other people in the class. Honestly, I really like messing with CSS more than I do with HTML. I guess it's the aspect of being able to change HTML to practically whatever you have in mind. I've been getting the hang of CSS with tons of help from Google and w3Schools. I still need more practice before I can really publish my own site, though. I really want to be able to use JavaScript with HTML and CSS just because of all the cool stuff I've seen on Codepen. I'd like to make some cool animations and effects for my website now that I've seen what Javascript can be used for.

## Personal Stuff
In regards to stuff outside of the class, I've had a pretty good week. I hanged out with some friends, went to some places, eat some good food, and had a great time. I also spent some time with my family at Wisconsin Dells, mainly at Mt. Olympus. I really wanted to go to on Hades, but no one from my family wanted to go with me since the line for the ride was too long (the waiting time was around 90 minutes!). After I got back from the Dells, I went with some friends again and had a great time just messing around and eating pizza. So I gotta say; this was pretty good week.
