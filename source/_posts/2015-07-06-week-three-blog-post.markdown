# YWebCA

I am now three weeks into the YWebCA program and I am feeling real good right now. I've been on top of all my stuff recently, which I've been able to do with the ability to bring the laptop home now. I've really liked seeing what this class has come to in terms of being out there for one another. Everyone is able to help each other out and teach one another very well, while having a great attitude and having fun as well.

We are now practically done with the second chapter of the Eloquent JavaScript worksheet, which was very subject-heavy in terms of content. I was able to finish quite early so I've been able to help others to finish the chapter as well. I was actually very surprised at how much content we learned in one chapter since I learned the same things when I learned Java but at a much slower pace in my high school class. We took less than a week to learn what a high school class learns in around 3 months. If that's not impressive, I don't know what is.

Anyways, on Friday, our class was split into two to simulate a company using Scrum. I've heard of Scrum before, mostly from the show "Silicon Valley", but have not really done it. Although it was my first time that I've used Scrum, I noticed how great it is to organize a team and how effective it is in terms of managing time. Honestly, I would love to become a Scrum master for a company if needed.

So far, this week has been great. Looking forward to next week as we are now organizing potlucks and continuing with the Scrum experience.
