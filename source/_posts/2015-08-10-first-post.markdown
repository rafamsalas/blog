## Welcome to my Blog!

This is my first post for this blog. I'm honestly excited for the rest of this course at this point. It's been quite an awesome first week and I believe this will be only one of many great weeks to come. So far, everyone is chill with one another and the class has an amazing atmosphere. The food was, unexpectedly, really, great with variety and what not. The potluck on Friday was absolutly incredible, since everyone brought something for the potluck and everyone had a great time. Since then, I have really connected with some of the classmates and met some friends that are taking the class with me as well.

I guess this is it for now, since I don't really have anything to add right now, but I do know that by the end of the course I'll have tons more to add to this blog.
