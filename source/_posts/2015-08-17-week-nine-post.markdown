## Week Nine Update
Ehh, this was one of those weeks. A lot of stuff happened that made this one of the more shittier weeks. First off, I accidentally spilled coffee on my laptop, which really hindered my progress on, well, everthing in class. Then, I had to spent over two hours waiting for the Apple Store, where I was told I either had to send the computer to a data recovery center or send it to repairs, to spend over $700. Naturally, I did what I would usually do in this situation; thought outside of that box. I was able to dry the computer as much as possible and see if I can at least get my files that I've been working on.

## Personal Stuff
My friend's birthday is on the 18th, so I had to plan to get something for him. I've been friends with him for a while, going through thick and thin. I'm pretty inclined to watch "Stright Outta Compton" with him, since we've got an inclination to more "old-school" rap. Anyways, I'm also going to Wisconsin Dells again next weekend, despite the fact that it's getting colder. Mainly, it's just going to be a "last summer memory" before starting to go to school.

Besides having fun at a waterpark, I've been doing trying to get most of my stuff from my previous computer to a new one, where I have been somewhat successful at.
