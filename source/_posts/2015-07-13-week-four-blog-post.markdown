# YWebCA

## Intro
Can't really believe that we are over a third the way done with the course. We've come a long way since we first started. Everyone has finished the Eloquent Javascript worksheet Chapter 2 and is ready for the next chapter. Now that the hardest part is over, we can now move on to functions and how to use them.

## Teach the Class Something
On Wednesday, I presented my "Teach the Classroom Something" part for the course. I chose to talk about Simulated Protein Folding, specifically what it is and how one can get involved through folding@home and foldit. I guess that's about it for this section.

## Madison+ UX Conference
YWebCA was invited to go to the Madison+ UX Conference Friday and Saturday, where UX designers from all over the country meet up in one of the biggest UX conferences in the US. I was surprised and a litte sad that this was going to be the last Madison+ UX conference ever since I was planning to go to next year's conference as well. Overall, I enjoyed the whole conference, since I learned a lot about the world of User Experience as well as learning about companies involved with it, locally and out of state. The presentations and speakers were amazing, with Chris Coyer's presentation being my absolute favorite in the conference. I was also able to get some free stuff, as well as eating on State Street, which was filled with great food.
