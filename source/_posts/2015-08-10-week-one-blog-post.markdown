## First Update

Wow, this week was packed with information, especially compared with the first week. We learned a lot about git commands, terminal commands, logic operators and more. We also started with JavaScript, with a very cool way to check our answers for our first worksheet using Jasmine.

I also started doing some outside work, specifically with the logic puzzles we were given Tuesday. I was able to finish up all of the puzzles early, although I think I spent too much time on the puzzles, especially considering that one of the puzzles literally had the answers under my nose, as it was later discussed on the page that the puzzles were on.

In regards to JavaScript, it is *very* similar to Java, so it was very familiar to me and I was able to finish the first worksheet fairly quickly. I have taken a look at the courses offered by CodeSchool, and I feel very familiar with the syntax and the structure of JavaScript. Of course, I will try not to jet ahead too much and be cautious of differences from the two languages, just so I don't get the languages mixed up or something like that. All in all, I really like how the teaching is laid out as of now. We first read a chapter from *Eloquent JavaScript* by Marjin Haverbeke, which is probably one of the best books on programming I have read, although that list is fairly short. We take notes, highlight, and discuss about topics and subjects covered in the chapter. Later, we work on a worksheet to evaluate our knowledge that we have graspedfrom the chapter. Honestly, this is a *way* better format of learning than most teachers. Or it may just be the classroom setting, the teachers, the topics, or the amount of time spent on the subject. Or all of those.


###Random stuff and Thoughts

Although I have loved this class so far, one thing is on my mind; the lunch food, which always consists of pizza. I mean, don't get me wrong, I love pizza, from classic pepperoni, cheese, mac & cheese, buffalo chicken (which is heaven) and Hawaiian, but when you have pizza pies every other day, it gets a little tiring. I thought I was able to accept the fact that I am willing to eat pizza every other day, but it hasn't been like that recently. My stomach isn't adjusted to eat REALLY greasy food, especially for several days a week. Plus, I would like to eat something a little more on the lighter side, such as a salad or a sub. I believe that not only do you need a healthy and working mind for any kind of work involved with critical thinking and any form of programming/web development, but a healthy and working body as well, so the whole aspect of having pizza for lunch consistently is something I can't agree with completely, especially when considering that we sit around for more that *7 hours a day* in this classroom.

Anyways, this class has been awesome so far, and I'm really looking forward to learning more in the class, both for gaining work experience and learning about web development.
